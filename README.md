# Tutee

This repository holds all of Tutee's application files.

## Application Structure

**Node** and **React** control the bulk of the application. The app's frontend is written with React, and Node utilizes the Express framework to handle the app's server and API. MySQL is the database of choice, but ```/server/models``` uses Sequelize as the app's ORM.

The Node back-end is stuctured using MVC architecture, and the front-end organizes the React components using atomic design theory.
