# Tutee

This repository holds all of Tutee's application dev files.

## Application Structure

**Node** and **React** control the bulk of the application. The app's frontend is written with React, Node utilizes the Express framework to handle the app's server and API, and MySQL manages the database.

The Node back-end is stuctured using MVC architecture, and the front-end organizes the React components using atomic design theory.

## Version Control
All releases on github mark the completion of a dev cycle, and signify a pass-over to the CI repo.
