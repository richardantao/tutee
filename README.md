# Tutee

This repository holds all of Tutee's application dev files.

## Application Structure

**Node** and **React** control the bulk of the application. The app's frontend is written with React, Node utilizes the Express framework to handle the app's server and API, and MongoDB powers the database.

The Node back-end is stuctured using MVC architecture, and the front-end organizes the React components using atomic design theory.
